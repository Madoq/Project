# To make it work
You need to upload project.sql on your database. After that it should work. Only one problem is save just dont want to work when js is added(or going direct to insert.php). when calc.js is clear, form works fine and add staff to a database. idk how to fix this issue. the logout button is on bottom left corner of the screen with text "Wyloguj siÄ™!", there is a hidden button just so it would be easier to press it. login and password to 3 premade accounts<br>
login password<br>

passwords are hashed so its not easy to just insert them. so i made few beforehand <br><br>
